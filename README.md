# HTML Canvas

This repository contains some dummy code examples of HTML Canvas, which I created while learning it. These examples can be used for reference and can be used, shared or modified without any permission.

## The Monster's Game

It's a simple game developed using Javacript, HTML5 & CSS3. It basically has two monsters, a _"Good Monster"_ (having green face) and an _"Evil Monster"_ (having red face)

The Goal of the player is to prevent _"Good Monster"_ from being caught by the _"Evil Monster"_. The user will score the points correponding to time duration before being caught by _"Evil Monster"_. Once, the _"Good Monster"_ gets caught, the game ends and final score is presented.

So Have Fun playing "The Monster's Game" :)

Note: I developed this game a long time ago, just for getting familiar with HTML Canvas, hence, please don't judge me for this.
