# HTML Canvas

This repository contains some dummy code examples of HTML Canvas, which I created while learning it. These examples can be used for reference and can be used, shared or modified without any permission.

The contributions to this project are welcome. You can contribute by improving the existing code examples, adding more examples or by enhancing  documentation.

## The Monster's Game

It's a simple game developed using Javacript, HTML5 & CSS3. It basically has two monsters, a _"Good Monster"_ (having green face) and an _"Evil Monster"_ (having red face)

The Goal of the player is to prevent _"Good Monster"_ from being caught by the _"Evil Monster"_. The user will score the points correponding to time duration before being caught by _"Evil Monster"_. Once, the _"Good Monster"_ gets caught, the game ends and final score is presented.

Have Fun playing "The Monster's Game" :)

__Note:__ I developed this game a long time ago, just for getting familiar with HTML Canvas. Hence, lot of improvements can be suggested for code as well as for game experience.
